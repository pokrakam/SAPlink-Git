# SAPlink-Git

SAPlink packaged for easy installation via [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapgit).

Motivation: The version at [sapmentors/SAPlink](https://github.com/sapmentors/SAPlink) is just a straight migration of the original SAPlink repository into GitHub. It still requires manual download and installation of separate pieces.

Use case: If you already use abapGit but still use `.nugg` or `.slnk` files, this is a quick and easy install of SAPlink with all plugins.

Even if you don't already use abapGit, you probably should :-)
